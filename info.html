          Duck Hunt is an exciting shooting simulation where the player ventures
          out with their faithful canine companion to hunt ducks. With a
          first-person perspective, the player is immersed in the marshland
          scenery as their dog skillfully flushes the ducks out of the
          vegetation, sending them into flight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using the mouse, the player has full control over their aim and shoots
          at the flying ducks. Only one duck appears at a time, and the
          objective is to hit it before it can escape. The player has three
          shots and a limited time of 10 seconds to bring down the duck.
          Precision is key, as each round of Duck Hunt allows only a limited
          number of errors to progress successfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the player advances through the various levels, the speed of the
          ducks increases, making the game progressively more challenging. At
          the tenth level, the difficulty reaches a new level with the
          appearance of two ducks simultaneously. Now, the player must hit both
          without fail; missing two shots results in the guaranteed escape of
          one of the ducks. As the levels progress, the ducks become even more
          agile, heightening the challenge and excitement of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each duck shot down earns the player points, while failing to hit a
          duck does not result in a loss of points. However, the goal is to
          achieve the necessary accuracy to accumulate points and progress in
          the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          The "Game Over" occurs when the player fails to hit the stipulated
          number of ducks for each round, challenging them to improve their
          skills to face new challenges.
